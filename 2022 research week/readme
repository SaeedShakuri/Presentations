This was a presentation titled 'An Introduction to Few-Shot Learning,' where I discussed the basics of Few-Shot Learning.
This presentation was part of the event that was to commemorate 'Research Week' and was held remotely by the University of Science and Culture.
It starts with a little background of AI and ML followed by basics and different categories of Few-Shot learning.
